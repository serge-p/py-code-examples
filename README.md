Code Examples in Python
==========================


Example 1 - Weighted Die:
-------------------------

####Task definition:

Letâ€™s implement model of six sided die with weights on the sides, 
so we don't have an even probability distribution, 
die is weighted by a list of weights passed in at construction time.  

####Testing conditions: 

After 100k iterations of throwing this die, 
the results should closely match the desired distribution, 
and this should be reproducible in the unit test example.  

since these are weights on a probability distribution, these should sum to one, 
and the incoming array should be of length 6. 
You should throw if either of these preconditions is false

	>>> from six_sided_dice import SixSidedWeightedDie
	>>> weights = [.05, .10, .15, .2, .2, .3]
	>>> SixSidedWeightedDie(weights).throw_die()
	3

	`python -m unittest test_weighted_dice`

Example 2 - palindrome generator
--------------------------------

####Task definition:  

1.  Let's implement palindrome generator, which reads a string of chars as an input, 
	and produces unique palindromes (strings which read the same reversed) 
	unique means that any following value was never produced before. 
 
2.  first produces all 1 letter palindromes, 
	then 2 letter ones, then ... 

For example: 
if given string is 'abc', then 'a', 'aa', 'aba', etc are all legal results 
(i.e., you can repeat the input chars just not the result).
